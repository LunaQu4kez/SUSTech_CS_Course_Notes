This forms a benchmark to compare your model against and becomes especially important in classification where your null accuracy might be 95 percent.\n",

So, if your model is less than 99% accurate, you know it is worse than the baseline. Imbalanced datasets generally must be trained differently (with less of a focus on accuracy) because of this."
